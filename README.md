# Windows DotFiles (originally gnome-theme)


I install a heap of operating systems for multiple reasons. <br>
For example, to try and give my opinion, or to switch to forever or a while.

For a while, I started this back with Windows 7 on the FX-8800P PC.
<br>
Then moving to a new computer (R7-5600X), in this order:
- Windows 7 (6.1) [Cloned from FX-8800P]
- Windows 11 (21h1)
- Windows 8 (6.2)
- Windows 8.1 (6.3)
- Windows 10 (LTSC 6.4)
- Windows 11 (23h2)

<br>

This repository includes:
- Windows 7 [AMD DRIVERS ONLY]
- Windows 8 (8.1) [Old Drivers]
- Windows 10 [No NVIDIA App]
- Windows 11 [23h2 Only]
